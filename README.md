## NextJS Based Reddit WebApp

In this project I will clone the Reddit Webapp by NextJS and realize the real world webApi by Firebase. The whole project is layout and design by Chakra-UI library and the state management is configured by Recoil.js, additionally, this project also built by Typescript.



#### About the Chakra-UI

The whole project components are wrapped by 'ChakraProvider' with the 'theme' property, in which it defines the global styles.
